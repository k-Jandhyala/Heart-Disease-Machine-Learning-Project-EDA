This Project makes use of the data repository on Heart Disease in Patients, which can be found on the UCI(University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). The theme of this project is based on the implementation of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in the HealthCare Field. The project aims to retrieve the data from UCI and apply a regression model and analysis on the data to determine if a patient presenting symptoms has the possibility to have Heart Disease
